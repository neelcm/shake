###*shake* allows any two people to quickly exchange contact information by simply shaking hands

shake takes advantage of Pebble's motion sensors to detect when a handshake has occurred. An Express backend evaluates concurrent requests containing raw handshake data and location-based information to determine which two people just met - both parties then receive each other's contact information.
