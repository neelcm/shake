{"name":"Shake","tagline":"exchange contact information via handshake","body":"![shake](http://neel.io/img/shake_banner.png)\r\n\r\n###*shake* allows any two people to quickly exchange contact information by simply shaking hands\r\n\r\nshake takes advantage of Pebble's motion sensors to detect when a handshake has occurred. A Node.js backend evaluates concurrent requests to determine which two people just met - both parties then receive each other's contact information.\r\n\r\nHow this works: When your pebble detects a handshake-like motion, the server is queried with your json-encoded contact card, raw handshake data and location-based information. Your pebble in return receives a contact card if someone else in the same time window was in your geofence with a similar handshake motion.\r\n\r\n![shake2](http://neel.io/img/shake_flow2.png)\r\n\r\n**technologies used:** C, JavaScript, Node.js, Express\r\n\r\n**created in under 36 hours by** [Neel Mouleeswaran](http://www.github.com/neelcm), [Vamsi Ponnapalli](http://www.github.com/vamsiponnapalli) & [Jeremy Sullivan](http://www.github.com/jeremy-sullivan192)\r\n\r\n<p align=\"right\">\r\n  <i><a href=\"http://challengepost.com/software/shake\">HackIllinois 2014 Submission</a></i>\r\n</p>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
